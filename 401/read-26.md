- **Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)**
  - Angular ðŸ¤®
  - Svelte
  - Vue (library)
  - Next 
  - Ember

- **Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?**
  - A framework is more restrictive in terms of how a developer design the application, the flow is controlled by the framework
  - A library is a set of functions that a developer can use anywhere in their app, giving more freedom since the dev controls the flow
    - A good example is like this: a library is like owning a house then going to **IKEA** to buy furniture, a framework is like choosing a house from a catalogue with some optional configurations.
