# AWS - S3 & Lambda λ

- **Describe “The Cloud”**
  - Online/remote resources (computing/storage)

- **What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?**
  - Containers allow you to package your application and its dependencies together into one succinct manifest that can be version controlled, allowing for easy replication of your application across developers on your team and machines in your cluster. [source](https://cloud.google.com/containers#:~:text=Containers%20allow%20you%20to%20package%20your%20application%20and%20its%20dependencies,and%20machines%20in%20your%20cluster.)

- **What is auto-scaling?**
  - Dynamically adjusting the amount of computational resources in a server farm - typically measured by the number of active servers - automatically based on the load on the farm. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoscaling)

- **What is bandwidth?**
  - It is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path. Bandwidth may be characterized as network bandwidth, data bandwidth, or digital bandwidth. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing))

- **How do cloud providers compute service costs?**
  - Cost of hardware resources allocated (CPU, GPU, RAM...)
  - Maintenance costs
  - Software licensing
  - Hosting
  - Security
  - All these costs are shared between organizations in the public cloud, making **IaaS** cost-effective
  - In the case of serverless &rarr; clients are charged based on run time.

- **Server Instances**
  - An instance is a single copy of the software running on a single physical or virtual server. If you run two copies of the software on the same physical or virtual server, that counts as two instances. [source](https://www.nginx.com/faq/what-is-an-instance/)

- **Containers**
  - Put simply, a container consists of an entire runtime environment: an application, plus all its dependencies, libraries and other binaries, and configuration files needed to run it, bundled into one package. By containerizing the application platform and its dependencies, differences in OS distributions and underlying infrastructure are abstracted away. [source](https://www.cio.com/article/2924995/what-are-containers-and-why-do-you-need-them.html)

- **Cloud Services**
  - Computing/storage services offered online/remotely.

- **Cloud Architecture**
  - Cloud Architecture refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. engineered to leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems. [source](https://www.hcltech.com/technology-qa/what-is-cloud-architecture#:~:text=Cloud%20Architecture%20refers%20to%20the,as%20the%20relationships%20between%20them.)

- **AWS**
  - Amazon Web Services (cloud services)

- **EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku**
  - EC2 is **IaaS** &rarr; Infrastructure service
  - Beanstalk and Heroku are **PaaS** &rarr; Platform services
