## What is Markdown

Think of Markdown as a way to add spices to normal text on the web... words can be **emphasized** or *tilted* easily... quotes can be added as well
> Usurper, do you have any last words?

Many other features can be added to the text, including:
- Headlines
- Emojis
- Mentions
as well as ordered and unordered lists such as the one above.


GitHub is an online service where programmers can store their code... think of it as a cloud service for programmers... it is even possible to publish a complete website using GitHub... possibilites are endless.
