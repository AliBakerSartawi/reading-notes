# HTML Readings

## Chapter 18: Process and Design

Before writing any line of **HTML** in the process of designing a website, the designer should identify the *targeted audience*, for it will influence the design **strategy** and **mentality**.

A **site map** is a diagram of the pages that will be created to structure the site... this is one of the first processes.

After that, comes the **wireframe** which is a simple sketch of the information/components that will go on each page... this will act as a skeleton for designing the user interface.

**Visual hierarchy** is an important aspect that will help the users understand the contents of the website the way the designer intended it... this includes variations in size, color and style.

## Chapter 1: Structure

**HTML** pages are structured into a **head** and a **body**, only information in the body will appear to the user.

The **body** is then structured into
- Header, which can include the name of the poage and some navigation options
- Main, which includes the actual content of the page
- Footer, which includes extra information... mostly similar in all the pages throughout the website

Each **HTML** line begins and ends with tags that dictate the nature of the line... is it a heading... a sub-heading... a paragraph... an image... etc etc.

## Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout

**HTML5** has elements... and when we say elements we mean header, footer, navigation, article and so on.

Using these elements helps developers describe the structure of the page... which lays more benefits than one can assume at first sight.

**HTML5** provides elements that result in a clearer-looking code than previous **HTML** versions.

**CSS** is a language that adds visual styles and variations... it can be added inside the **HTML** elements to give it a visual treatment.

## Chapter 8: Extra Markup

There extra elements that can be implemented in **HTML5** such as a *comment* element that allows the developers to add notes inside the code which will not be visible to interface users.

*ID and Class Attributes* elements can be added to give certain content different visual features than the content around it. 

The *iframe* element can be used to add what looks like a window inside the page... useful for embedding google maps for instance.

The *meta* tag allows the developer to add information located in the head section... it will not be visible to users... but can be useful for search engines.

There are many other tags and elements for many other useful purposes.
