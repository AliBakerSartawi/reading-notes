## What is Git

Imagine that you are working on a project, and along the way you wanted to go back a few steps... but you have no backup of that earlier version of your work... *too bad*.

The solution is to have something called **VCS**, short for *Version Control System*... allowing you to go back in time to earlier versions of your work at ease.
