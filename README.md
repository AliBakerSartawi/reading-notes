## Growth Mindset

Time moves and never stops... trees grow and flowers flourish... we exist in this space and are bound by its rules... the rules of constant motion... *the growth mindset is when one realizes that the only limits we face are the ones we set for ourselves*...  

### How to maintain a constant mindset of growth

A few **strategies** can be adopted:

1. [Remember that after pain, there is always gain](https://www.marylebonephysio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/No-Pain-No-Gain.jpg)
2. [Each mistake is nothing but a learning curve into more success](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/bd/1d/0a/bd1d0a463bf72d589e3b053aefe0b527--making-mistakes-learn-from-your-mistakes.jpg)
3. [When criticized, consider it a form of feedback to further improve oneself](https://www.quotemaster.org/images/bc/bc2aef151dfd5ad60e072a7f64e058be.jpeg) 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/AliBakerSartawi/reading-notes/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/AliBakerSartawi/reading-notes/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
