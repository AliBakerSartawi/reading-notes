## `Images`

An image can be added in `HTML` using the following 

```html
<img src="image link here" alt="text in case image does not load" width="500" height="250"/>
```

The image link can be from anywhere on the web, or it can be from a local directory.

`Jpeg` formats are suitable for images with many colors, `png` and `gif` are suitable for images with few colors. `SVG` is a vector type format that is useable as well.

## `Color`

When styling with CSS, colors can be referred to in many ways:
- by RGB values
- by HEX codes
- or by color name... which are 147 predefined ones that are recognizable by browsers.

Furthermore, CSS allows for hue, saturation, brightness and opacity values to be edited as well.

## `Text`

Selecting a typeface for your website has to be a careful process... each font family reflect a certain mood and aura... it should match the purpose of the website.

The default text size in browsers is 16 pixels. Font formats also include **bold** and *italic* styles.

`Line heights` can be adjusted, as well as `text-alignment`.
