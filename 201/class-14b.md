## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

This study talks about why some groups thrive and others don't.

When being in a study group of talented individuals, some participants can feel pressured into having to constantly prove themselves.

Sometimes ego takes place into who is the leader of the group, creating uncalled-for drama and distraction.

The member with the issue tried another group, the dynamic of the other group suited her... and they all clicked.

Even though both groups were intelligent... but different personalities.

Companies now realize the optimizing each worker alone isn't enough... there has to be optimization for the whole group of workers. The dynamic must be found... the harmony.. the click.

The important thing about group-work is the innovation... put more minds in the pot and you have more ideas and more solutions faster.

**Google's Project Aristotle** was to study its employees lives and figure out the best combination of teams they can create.

Some teams were identical in composition yet almost opposite in results... the puzzled Google.

They discovered the subconscious development of unspoken rules in each group... behaviors that enforce productivity or hinder it. they called it **group norms**. 

Then, other researchers dabbled with the idea of a **collective IQ** that can emerge from a group.

They found out that productivity and results emanated from how the teammates treated each other.. that was the core of the group's **collective IQ**.

They also realized some details in good groups
- Mostly, all members spoke in equal amounts to each other
- All members had a significant amount of *average social sensitivity*, meaning they had good intuition in understanding each other from the tone of voice

Meaning that if **team A** was serious minded, and **team B** was free-flowing... go for **team B**.

In the end, I would love to add my own simplification for all of this... they key behind a successful group is a decent amount of talent, then tons of respect, humbleness, intuition and empathy.

Another aspect that they talked about, is realising the the thin line between life and work... and how sometimes this thin line gets diminished... and work becomes life... this might lead to the necessity of the teammates sharing life-related information that might increase understanding and empathy between them... even might increase sympathy. This can lead to a better working dynamic... as long as no one in the group will abuse that psychologically.

This is what gave birth to the term **psychologically safe**... meaning you can show up at work no having to put on a work face... knowing that you can share personal information... shifting the workplace into a second family... or at least a close group of collaborative and respecting friends.

Lastly, to be a good team member... listen to your teammates, and be sensitive to their feelings.
