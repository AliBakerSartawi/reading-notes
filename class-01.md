# HTML

## Introduction

When you type a domain name or a web address into a browser, the computer will contact a network of servers called **Domain Name System** or shortly **DNS** which act like phone books... meaning that they will give you the **IP address** associated with the requested domain name allowing the computer to contact the web server that is hosting the requested website.

Then, the web server will send the requested web page to the computer.



## Structure

**HTML** pages are structured into a **head** and a **body**, only information in the body will appear to the user.

The **body** is then structured into
- Header, which can include the name of the poage and some navigation options
- Main, which includes the actual content of the page
- Footer, which includes extra information... mostly similar in all the pages throughout the website

Each **HTML** line begins and ends with tags that dictate the nature of the line... is it a heading... a sub-heading... a paragraph... an image... etc etc.



## Extra Markup

There extra elements that can be implemented in **HTML5** such as a **comment** element that allows the developers to add notes inside the code which will not be visible to interface users.

**ID and Class Attributes** elements can be added to give certain content different visual features than the content around it. 

The **iframe** element can be used to add what looks like a window inside the page... useful for embedding google maps for instance.

The **meta** tag allows the developer to add information located in the head section... it will not be visible to users... but can be useful for search engines.

There are many other tags and elements for many other useful purposes.



## HTML5 Layout

**HTML5** has elements... and when we say elements we mean header, footer, navigation, article and so on.

Using these elements helps developers describe the structure of the page... which lays more benefits than one can assume at first sight.

**HTML5** provides elements that result in a clearer-looking code than previous **HTML** versions.

**CSS** is a language that adds visual styles and variations... it can be added inside the **HTML** elements to give it a visual treatment.



## Process and Design

Before writing any line of **HTML** in the process of designing a website, the designer should identify the *targeted audience*, for it will influence the design **strategy** and **mentality**.

A **site map** is a diagram of the pages that will be created to structure the site... this is one of the first processes.

After that, comes the **wireframe** which is a simple sketch of the information/components that will go on each page... this will act as a skeleton for designing the user interface.

**Visual hierarchy** is an important aspect that will help the users understand the contents of the website the way the designer intended it... this includes variations in size, color and style.



# JavaScript

## Introduction

**Javascript** is like rules to modify html... such as adding slideshows and forms and buttons... or editing certain parts of **HTML** elements.

## The ABC of Programming

Drawing a **flowchart** helps in the process of writing the script in a logical way that the computer will understand how to apply.

The **Script** is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.

Web browsers use **HTML** markup to create a model of the web page. Each element creates its own node, *which is a kind of object*. To make web pages interactive, you write code that uses the browser's model of the web page.

Making mistakes in writing script is very common.. there are ways to discover this... this is called **debugging**.

It is best to keep **JavaScript** code in a separate file, then use the *script* tag in **HTML** to tell the browser to load the **JavaScript** file.

**Javascript** can also perform arithemtic operations to calculate shipping or checkout totals or any other thing... or perform logical operations to manifest **true** or **false** results.
