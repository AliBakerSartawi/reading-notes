# HTML Readings

## Chapter 18: Process and Design

Before writing any line of **HTML** in the process of designing a website, the designer should identify the *targeted audience*, for it will influence the design **strategy** and **mentality**.

A **site map** is a diagram of the pages that will be created to structure the site... this is one of the first processes.

After that, comes the **wireframe** which is a simple sketch of the information/components that will go on each page... this will act as a skeleton for designing the user interface.

**Visual hierarchy** is an important aspect that will help the users understand the contents of the website the way the designer intended it... this includes variations in size, color and style.
