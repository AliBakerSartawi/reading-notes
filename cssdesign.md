## Design with CSS

CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements... giving the web page a stylised look.

CSS can be applied inside HTML elements, or written in a separate file then referenced inside the HTML file.

When designing a website with multiple pages, keeping the CSS file separate allows to change the styling for all the pages by simply editing the one CSS file.

## Color

When styling with CSS, colors can be referred to in many ways:
- by RGB values
- by HEX codes
- or by color name... which are 147 predifined ones that are recognizable by browsers.

Furthermore, CSS allows for hue, saturation, brightness and opacity values to be edited as well.
