## SQL

**Structured Query Language** or **SQL** is a language designed to allow users to query, manipulate and transform data from a relational database.

**SQL** databases include SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server... all of them support the main features of **SQL**, yet they can differ in some additional features depending on the type of data it supports.

A **relational database** represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write **SELECT** statements, which are often colloquially referred to as queries. A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned.
