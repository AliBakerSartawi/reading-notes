## REST

**HTTP** is said to be one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing... it is capable of describing the location of something in the world from anywhere in the world.

The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called **REST**. **REST** provides a definition of a *resource*, which is what those things point to.

Web pages are a representation of a resource, the **URL** tells the browser where to look for the resource, and the resource page can sometimes end up with another **URL** that *redirects* us to another resource.

Machines/websites/servers can be in different languages... different nouns... but nouns have verbs, and some verbs are universal across nouns... such as **GET**.

Using the **HTTP** protocol, the browser **GETs** the images of a website that are hosted somewhere else, for instance.

**HTTP** is not just for **GETting**, it is a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns.

The vision is that it can be used to **GET** or **PUT** or **PATCH** nouns such as *students* and *grades* and *classes* but on a national or international scale, for example...

This is what engineers are working on using **RESTful** web frameworks like **Ruby on Rails**
