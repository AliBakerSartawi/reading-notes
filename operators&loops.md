## Comparison Operators

They are used to manifest Boolean results, which are **true** and **flase** results.

The operators include:
- == equal to
- != not equal to
- === strictly equal to... they have to match in amount and data type
- !== strictly not equal to
- \> greater than
- < less than
- \>= greater than or equal
- <= less than or equal

## Logical Operators

They allows us to compare the results of more than one comparison operator

The operators are:
- && logical and
- \|| logical or
- logical not... it takes a single Boolean value and inverts it... for example: (2 < 1) is false, but !(2 < 1) is true

Here is an example of && and ||
- ((2 < 5) && (3 >= 2)) this returns true
- ((2 < 5) \|| (2 < 1)) this returns true

## Loops

The **For** loop will run a code for a number of specified times depending on the condition set.
- an basic example would look like this: for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)

The **While** loop will run a code for as many times as the condition is **true**
